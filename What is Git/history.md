# A short history #

Git has been around for quite some time now, almost 10 years now. In 2005, a group of developers working on a thing called `Linux kernel` among them a guy named Linus Torvalds, got annoyed by their version control system they used to maintain this development.

Torvalds then started developing their own VCS, and named it Git. According to him, it's named after 'an unpleasant person', referring to himself.

# Why Git #

Various reasons to use Git exist, but the most important ones are listed below:
* Non-linear development: if you're working on a certain function, and some urgent changes need to be done in the meanwhile, you want to keep your developed code safe, without affecting the new changes (because the new function hasn't been finished, for example)
* Local copy: having a local copy of the code on your machine has the major benefit of being fast, because it doesn't need to rely on external connections or servers
